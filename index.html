        <h2>Who we are..</h2>
        <div id="DEsc1">Good question! Quite simply, management consultants, like McKinsey, help their clients solve problems.

            Let's unpack this statement and analyze each component a little more carefully to get more insight. Let's start by looking at an actual verbatim statement from one the preeminent management consulting firms, McKinsey, about what they do. Read it and then we'll break it down and analyze it.
            The clients are often leading businesses (e.g., Fortune 1,000 companies like Coca-Cola and Microsoft), investors (e.g., Private Equity firms like KKR), governments (e.g., US Dept. of Energy) and nonprofits (e.g., Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation).

            While each consulting firm will have a different client base (and sometimes different sector focus), the primary customers of many consulting firms come from the first category: leading businesses. We'll revisit this more below.
            Given that leading businesses are the primary customers of consulting firms, you might immediately ask: why do leading businesses, who likely can likely hire the world's best talent, need to hire expensive consultants to help them with their problems? While there are edge cases, there are three core reasons that drive the bulk of the consulting business.

                <div id="explain">Business intelligence combines business analytics, data mining, data visualization, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organizations make more data-driven decisions. In practice, you know you’ve got modern business intelligence when you have a comprehensive view of your organization’s data and use that data to drive change, eliminate inefficiencies, and quickly adapt to market  changes.</div>

<div id="explain">Database Management allows a person to organize, store, and retrieve data from a computer. Database Management can also describe the data storage, operations, and security practices of a database administrator (DBA) throughout the life cycle of the data. Managing a database involves designing, implementing, and supporting stored data to maximize its value.</div>

               <h4> Cloud Computing</h4>
               <div id="explain">In simple terms, cloud computing allows you to rent instead of buy your IT. Rather than investing heavily in databases, software, and hardware, companies opt to access their compute power via the internet, or the cloud, and pay for it as they use it. These cloud services now include, but are not limited to, servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and business intelligence.
